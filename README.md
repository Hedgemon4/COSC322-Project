# COSC322-Project

This is the repo for our COSC 322 AI project. It contains an implementation of an AI bot in Java to play the Game of Amazons. 

## Techniques

We used a Monte Carlo Search tree with early termination simulation for the bot, an opening move dictionary, and an expansion policy based on taking
space in the middle of the board and prioritizing piece liberty.

## Other Branches

There are several other branches which were not merged in for the project where we attempted to implement various techniques
into our bot. These included:

- Neural Network Model for Expansion and Simulation: https://github.com/Hedgemon4/COSC322-Project/pull/30
- Simulation Policy Using our Move Dictionary: https://github.com/Hedgemon4/COSC322-Project/pull/34
- Simulation Policy Using an Advanced Heuristic: https://github.com/Hedgemon4/COSC322-Project/pull/33
- Simulation Policy Using Move Maximization: https://github.com/Hedgemon4/COSC322-Project/pull/17
